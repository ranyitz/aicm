> Agentic IDE Configuration Manager

A CLI tool for syncing and managing Agentic IDE rules across projects

## Why

With the rise of Agentic IDEs like cursor and windsurf, we have an opportunity to enforce best practices through rules. However, these rules are typically isolated within individual developers or projects.

**aicm** is a CLI tool for distributing Agentic IDE configurations, rules, and MCPs across projects. It leverages package managers to copy configurations from node_modules to the correct locations in your file system.

## Getting Started

Since aicm is not a package manager, begin by creating an npm package that contains your rules and MCP configurations.

Consider the following npm package structure:

```
@myteam/ai-tools
├── package.json
└── rules/
    ├── typescript.mdc
    └── react.mdc
```

1. **Point to the path within the npm package**

In your project's `aicm.json`, reference the package and the specific rule:

```json
{
  "ides": ["cursor"],
  "rules": {
    "typescript": "@myteam/ai-tools/rules/typescript.mdc",
    "react": "@myteam/ai-tools/rules/react.mdc"
  }
}
```

2. **Add a postinstall script** to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "npx -y aicm install"
  }
}
```

Now the rules will be linked to `.cursor/rules/` when you run `npm install`.

### Using Presets

Presets allow you to bundle multiple rules & mcps into a single configuration that can be shared across projects.

1. **Create a preset package or directory**

Create an npm package with your rule definitions in an `aicm.json` file:

> `@myteam/ai-tools/aicm.json`

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "typescript": "./rules/typescript.mdc",
    "react": "./rules/react.mdc"
  },
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-mcp": {
      "url": "https://example.com/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Reference the preset in your project**

In your project's `aicm.json`, reference the preset by its npm package or directory name:

```json
{
  "ides": ["cursor"],
  "presets": ["@myteam/ai-tools"]
}
```

When you run `npx aicm install`, all rules from the preset will be installed to `.cursor/rules/` and all mcps from the preset will be installed to `.cursor/mcp.json`.

### Overriding and Disabling Rules and MCP Servers from Presets

When you use a preset, you can override or disable any rule or mcpServer from the preset in your own `aicm.json` configuration:

- **Override**: To override a rule or mcpServer, specify the same key in your config with a new value. The value in your config will take precedence over the preset.
- **Disable**: To disable a rule or mcpServer from a preset, set its value to `false` in your config.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "ides": ["cursor"],
  "presets": ["@company/ai-rules/aicm.json"],
  "rules": {
    "rule-from-preset-a": "./rules/override-rule.mdc",
    "rule-from-preset-b": false
  },
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-from-preset-a": {
      "command": "./scripts/override-mcp.sh",
      "env": { "MCP_TOKEN": "override" }
    },
    "mcp-from-preset-b": false
  }
}
```

### Demo

We'll install an npm package containing a simple rule to demonstrate how aicm works.

1. Install an npm package containing a rule

```bash
npm install --save-dev pirate-coding-rule
```

2. Initialize aicm config

```bash
npx -y aicm init
```

3. Add the rule to your config file: `aicm.json`

```json
{
  "ides": ["cursor"],
  "rules": {
    "pirate-coding": "pirate-coding-rule/rule.mdc"
  }
}
```

4. Install all rules from your configuration

```bash
npx -y aicm install
```

This command installs all configured rules and MCPs to their IDE-specific locations.

After installation, open Cursor and ask it to do something. Your AI assistant will respond with pirate-themed coding advice.

## Security Note

To prevent [prompt-injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_injection), use only packages from trusted sources.

## Configuration

To configure aicm, use either:

- a root-level `aicm.json` file, **or**
- an `aicm` key in your project's `package.json`.

Example `aicm.json`:

```json
{
  "ides": ["cursor"],
  "presets": ["@my-team/ai-tools/my-aicm.json"],
  "rules": {
    "team-rules/team-standards": "@my-team/ai-tools/rules/team-standards.mdc"
  },
  "mcpServers": {
    "remote-mcp": {
      "url": "https://example.com/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

- **ides**: Array of IDE names where rules should be installed. Currently supported values:

  - `"cursor"`: For the Cursor IDE

- **rules**: Object containing rule configurations

  - **rule-name**: A unique identifier for the rule. Can include a directory path to install the rule to a specific directory.
  - **source-location**: Location of the rule file (path within an npm package or local path)

- **mcpServers**: Object containing MCP server configurations. Each key is a unique server name, and the value is an object with either:

  - **command**: The command or script to run (with optional **args** and **env**), or
  - **url**: The URL to fetch the MCP config from (with optional **env**)

- **presets**: Array of preset configurations to include. Each preset is a path to a JSON file (npm package or local path) that contains additional rules and mcpServers.

  - Preset files should contain a `rules` and `mcpServers` objects with the same structure as the main configuration.

### MCP Server Installation

- **Cursor**: MCP server configs are written to `.cursor/mcp.json` (see Cursor docs for latest path).
- **Windsurf**: Windsurf does not support project mcpServers. MCP server configuration is not installed for Windsurf projects.

### Rule Source Types

The type of rule is automatically detected based on the source format:

#### NPM Source

Rules provided by NPM packages. The package must be installed either globally or in your project's `node_modules`. Sources that start with `@` or don't contain start with path separators are detected as NPM packages.

```json
"react-best-practices": "@my-team/ai-tools/aicm-react"
```

#### Local Source

Rules stored locally in your project or filesystem. Any path containing slashes or backslashes is detected as a local file path.

```json
"personal-rules": "./rules/custom.mdc"
```

## Supported IDEs

- **Cursor**: Rules are installed as individual `.mdc` files in the Cursor rules directory (`.cursor/rules/`), mcp servers are installed to `.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Windsurf**: Rules are installed in the `.rules` directory which should be added to your `.gitignore` file. Our approach for Windsurf is to create links from the `.windsurfrules` file to the respective rules in the `.rules` directory. There is no support for local mcp servers at the moment.
