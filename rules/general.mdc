## Development Standards

- Use pnpm for package management
- Development workflow: e2e tests → implementation → verification
- Document all features in README.md
- Never modify CHANGELOG.md

## Code Formatting

- Use Prettier for code formatting with the configuration in [.prettierrc](mdc:.prettierrc)
- Run `pnpm format` to format all files
- All code should be formatted for minimal diff previews
